# Upgrade round 1 — status

Running log for [`UPGRADE_PLAN.md`](UPGRADE_PLAN.md). **Append, never rewrite.**

This file exists so work can be resumed cold, by someone (or something) with no
memory of the session that started it. If you are picking this up: read the
plan, read this file, run `git log --oneline`, run the suite, then take the
first package below whose state is not `done`.

**Ground rules that survive a restart** — the full set is §0 of the plan, but
these are the ones that get forgotten:

- Production is live. `MIGRATIONS[0]` is frozen; new entries only, versions
  claimed from the plan's §1 registry.
- Never run a migration, a tool, or the server against the repo-root
  `testboard.db` — it holds a copy of real data. Work on copies in a temp
  directory.
- Guard tests (`test_frontend_calls.py`, `test_server_pool.py`,
  `test_python36_compat.py`, `test_migrations.py`) encode production findings.
  Widen them; never weaken them.
- Full suite green before every commit. One package, one commit. Do not push.

## Log

### 2026-07-27 — planning

Wrote `UPGRADE_PLAN.md` (12 packages) and `MARIADB_MIGRATION.md` (runbook).

Decision taken by the user: **vendor the MySQL driver** so nothing is installed
on site. Plan §4 decision 1 closed; WP-11 added.

Baseline at the start of implementation: **808 tests, OK (skipped=1)**, working
tree otherwise clean at `964e0b4`.

Still outstanding and **not** a code task: `tools/diagnose_db.py --compare-local`
has not been run on production since the worker-pool fix. Every timing predating
that fix describes a server that discarded its page cache every request.

### WP-0 — migration registry guard — **done**

`tests/test_migrations.py`, 19 tests. Migration 1 is pinned by a
whitespace- and comment-insensitive SHA-256 of its DDL
(`9b9dd4d0…`). Suite 808 → 827.

Two things worth knowing if this file is ever revisited:

- The first version of the fingerprint collapsed runs of whitespace but not
  spacing *around punctuation*, so re-indenting the DDL changed the digest.
  A freeze that trips on reformatting gets its constant updated as routine
  maintenance and stops meaning anything. Caught by
  `test_the_fingerprint_ignores_formatting_but_not_content`, which exists for
  exactly that reason. The digest changed when it was fixed.
- The planted regression was run for real, not just asserted at string level:
  a `planted_column TEXT` added to entry 1 in `storage.py` fails
  `test_migration_one_matches_what_was_deployed`. Verified, then reverted.

### WP-11 — vendor PyMySQL — **done**

`third_party/pymysql` 1.0.2 (last release supporting 3.6; 1.1.0 raised its floor
to 3.7). MIT, pure Python, no dependencies of its own, 18 files. Wired to
nothing — a test enforces that, so reverting stays a one-commit operation.
Suite 827 → 844.

Four things found on the way that are not obvious from the diff:

- **`cryptography` is an optional PyMySQL dependency** needed for
  `sha256_password` / `caching_sha2_password`. It is compiled, so vendoring it
  would destroy the "nothing to build on the server" property. MariaDB defaults
  to `mysql_native_password` and needs none of it — but the DB account must be
  created with that plugin. Added to the runbook §A.2 and its troubleshooting
  table, because the error message names a Python package and the fix is a SQL
  grant.
- **`paramstyle` is `pyformat`, not `format`.** The plan said `format`. Pinned
  by a test, because a stray `?` reaches MariaDB as a literal question mark
  rather than failing loudly.
- **The PEP 604 detector false-positived on vendored code.** Its
  module-level-assignment arm cannot distinguish `Number = int | float` from
  `CAPABILITIES = LONG_PASSWORD | LONG_FLAG | ...`, and PyMySQL's constants
  modules are full of the latter. That arm is now optional and off for vendored
  code; the gap it leaves (a vendored type alias using `|`) is caught by the
  ubi8/python-36 CI job, where it is a TypeError at import.
- **The "opens no socket at import" test could not be written as a
  monkeypatch.** Replacing `socket.socket` breaks `ssl.SSLSocket`, which
  subclasses it, so the test failed inside the standard library before reaching
  the driver. It uses `sys.addaudithook` instead, plus a companion test proving
  the hook actually fires on a real network call.

### WP-4 — deactivate users — **done**

Migration **2**: `users.deactivated_at`, `users.deactivated_by`. Presence of the
timestamp is the state, matching `test_retirements` — reversible, and no boolean
that can disagree with its own timestamp. Suite 844 → 869.

**Migration timing, measured not estimated.** Applied to a copy of the real
database (218 MB, 540,192 runs, 12,008 tests): **31 ms**, including opening the
connection. `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` does not rewrite rows in SQLite, so this
does not grow with the database — production being larger changes nothing.
Verified afterwards: row counts unchanged, existing users read as active.

Exercised against that copy through the running server, not only through tests.
The 409 fired on real data — `priya` genuinely owned two tests — then reassigning
them let the deactivation through, the picker list dropped to two names, and an
attempt to assign to the deactivated account was refused.

Decisions worth not re-litigating:

- **Deactivating an owner is a hard 409, not a warning.** Work assigned to a
  name no picker offers is an invisible queue; nothing would ever surface it.
- **Retired tests do not count as open work.** Retirement deliberately leaves
  the assignment in place, so counting them would block deactivation forever
  over work that no longer exists.
- **Clearing an assignment is never blocked** — it is the way out of the
  situation, not another instance of it.
- **`assigneeSelect` injects `entry.assignee` even when absent from the fetched
  list, and that is deliberate.** With active-only listing, a test still owned
  by a deactivated account would otherwise render with an empty dropdown and
  look unassigned. There is now a comment there saying so.

Two things found by running it rather than by testing it:

- The `<details>` panel loaded its list on the `toggle` event only. `toggle`
  fires on a *change*, so a panel that is already open on arrival — markup, or
  browser-restored state — showed an empty table forever. Now it also loads if
  it is open at init.
- `tests/test_frontend_calls.py` fired, correctly: `actions.js` now names
  `/api/users` twice more. **Widened, not weakened** — mutations (`putJson`) and
  the admin roster (`include_inactive=1`, a different result set, fetched lazily
  and once) are exempt; a second fetch of the *assignable* list, which is what
  caused the original 250-request stampede, is still banned. A new test keeps
  the exemption narrow.
